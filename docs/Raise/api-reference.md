# API reference

Every implemented endpoint, grouped by domain, with the authentication and
permission each one requires.

- **Base path:** `/api/v1`
- **Contract of record:** [`packages/api/openapi.yaml`](../packages/api/openapi.yaml)
  request and response schemas live there, not here.
- **Interactive:** Swagger UI at `http://localhost:3000/api/docs`; raw YAML at
  `/api/openapi.yaml`.
- **Generated client types:** `packages/web/src/lib/api-types.ts`, produced by
  `npm run gen:api-types --workspace=@raise/web`.

This page is the navigable index: what exists, who may call it, and where the
code is. Use it to find an endpoint; use the YAML for its payload.

## Conventions

| Aspect | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Auth | HttpOnly cookies. `accessToken` (15 min, path `/api/v1`), `refreshToken` (30 days, path `/api/v1/auth/refresh`), both `httpOnly`, `sameSite=lax`, `secure` in production |
| Caching | Every `/api/v1` response carries `Cache-Control: no-store` |
| Errors | `{ code?, error, errors?, stack? }` see [backend.md](backend.md#error-model) |
| Validation failures | `400` with `code: "VALIDATION_ERROR"` and `errors: [{ field, message }]` |
| Pagination | `?page` (min 1) and `?limit` (1–100) query parameters |
| Rate limiting | Global 600 requests / 15 min per IP, plus the per-scope limiters noted below |

### Permission notation

`documents:share` means `requirePermission("documents", "share")`, checked
against the caller's role in the startup named by `:startupId`. Every
startup-scoped route additionally runs `authenticate` and `requireMember`
(active membership). The full matrix is in [security.md](security.md).

## Health and platform

Outside `/api/v1`.

| Method | Path | Auth | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/health` | none | Process liveness. Never touches dependencies. |
| GET | `/ready` | none | PostgreSQL + Redis with a 2s timeout; `503` when either is down |
| GET | `/metrics` | Bearer `METRICS_TOKEN` | Prometheus-compatible reviewer metrics. Disabled unless `METRICS_ENABLED=true` |
| GET | `/api/openapi.yaml` | none | Raw contract |
| GET | `/api/docs` | none | Swagger UI |

## Authentication

`src/routes/auth.routes.ts`. `authRateLimiter` counts all attempts;
`credentialRateLimiter` counts only failures. Both are 10 per 15 minutes.

| Method | Path | Auth | Limiter | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/auth/register/initiate` | none | auth | Start registration, email an OTP |
| POST | `/auth/register/resend` | none | auth | Resend the registration OTP |
| POST | `/auth/register/verify` | none | credential | Verify OTP, create the account, sign in |
| POST | `/auth/login` | none | credential | Password sign-in |
| POST | `/auth/google` | none | credential | Google ID-token sign-in |
| POST | `/auth/refresh` | refresh cookie | | Rotate the token pair |
| POST | `/auth/logout` | session | credential | Revoke the session family |
| GET | `/auth/me` | session | | Current user |
| POST | `/auth/forgot-password` | none | auth | Email a reset link |
| POST | `/auth/reset-password` | none | credential | Complete the reset |

## Users

`src/routes/user.routes.ts`, plus one raw-body route registered in `app.ts`.

| Method | Path | Auth | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| PATCH | `/users/me` | session | Update profile |
| PUT | `/users/me/avatar` | session | Raw image bytes (`image/webp` or `image/png`, ≤600 KB). Registered in `app.ts` ahead of `express.json()`, with its own rate limiter |
| DELETE | `/users/me/avatar` | session | Remove avatar |
| GET | `/avatar-files/:userId/:filename` | none | Local-storage avatar fallback. Public and cache-friendly on purpose |

## Startups, roles, and members

| PATCH | `/startups/:startupId` | `startup:update` | Edit profile |
| DELETE | `/startups/:startupId` | `startup:delete` | Delete workspace |

| POST | `/startups/:startupId/roles` | `team:manage` | Create a custom role |
| PATCH | `/startups/:startupId/roles/:roleId` | `team:manage` | Edit a role |

| POST | `/invites/mine/:memberId/accept` | session | Accept |
| POST | `/invites/mine/:memberId/decline` | session | Decline |
| POST | `/invites/accept` | optional session | Accept by token from an email link. Uses `optionalAuthenticate` so a signed-out visitor can be routed to sign-in and so a stranger holding the link cannot act as the invited person |

## Notifications and realtime

`src/routes/notification.routes.ts`. All routes require a session.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/notifications` | Paginated feed |

|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/fundraising-rounds` | `financial:read` *or* `pipeline:read` | List rounds. With only `pipeline:read` every amount comes back `null` and the row is marked `financialsRedacted` enough for the pipeline board to scope itself to a round, not enough to read the raise. |

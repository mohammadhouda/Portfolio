# Backend guide

How `packages/api` is organized, the conventions every resource follows, and
the recipe for adding one. Read [architecture.md](architecture.md) first for
the system-level picture and [security.md](security.md) for the authorization
rules this guide assumes.

## Process bootstrap

`server.ts` runs in a fixed order and none of it is incidental:

1. Load `dotenv`.
2. `validateEnv()` exit before anything else can half-start.
3. Import `app.ts` (importing earlier would read unvalidated configuration).
4. `prisma.$connect()`, then `app.listen(PORT)`.
5. Register `SIGTERM`/`SIGINT` handlers that close the HTTP server (10s grace,
   then force), close queues, then Redis and Prisma.

Scheduled tasks are not part of the API's bootstrap the worker process
registers them once at its own boot. See
[background-jobs.md](background-jobs.md#scheduled-tasks).

`app.ts` middleware order also matters:

| Order | Middleware | Why here |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `app.set("trust proxy", …)` | Must precede anything reading `req.ip` |
| 2 | `helmet()`, credentialed `cors()` | Security headers before handlers |
| 3 | `cookieParser()` | Sessions are cookie-based |
| 4 | `PUT /api/v1/documents/local-upload/:token` (raw body) | Raw bytes must precede `express.json()` |
| 5 | `PUT /api/v1/users/me/avatar` (raw body) | Same reason; carries its own `rateLimiter` + `authenticate`, since registering ahead of the global limiter would otherwise leave it unthrottled |
| 6 | `express.json({ limit: "1mb" })`, `urlencoded` | Normal payloads |
| 7 | `pinoHttp` | Structured request logs (skipped in tests) |
| 8 | `Cache-Control: no-store` on `/api/v1` | Every response is session-scoped; a cached copy could be replayed for the next user |
| 9 | `rateLimiter` on `/api/v1/` | Global ceiling |
| 10 | `router` | Application routes |
| 11 | `/api/docs`, `/api/openapi.yaml`, `/metrics`, `/health`, `/ready` | Outside `/api/v1` on purpose |
| 12 | `errorHandler` | Must be last |

## Layering

```text
routes/<resource>.routes.ts        HTTP contract + middleware composition
controllers/<resource>.controller.ts  Thin: read req, call service, shape response
services/<resource>.service.ts     Business rules, transactions, tenant-scoped Prisma
validators/<resource>.schemas.ts   Zod schemas + inferred input types
```

### Routes

Routes declare the contract and compose middleware. They contain no business
logic. Startup-scoped routers are mounted from `startup.routes.ts` with
`mergeParams: true` so `:startupId` is visible downstream.

```ts
router.patch(
  "/:investorId",
  authenticate,
  validate(investorIdParamSchema, "params"),
  requireMember,
  requirePermission("pipeline", "update"),
  validate(updateInvestorSchema),
  investorController.updateInvestor,
);
```

The order is load-bearing: params are validated before `requireMember` reads
`req.params.startupId`, and permissions are checked before the body is parsed.

### Controllers

Thin by design, wrapped in `asyncHandler` so rejections reach the error
middleware. They translate HTTP to service calls and back no Prisma, no
business branching.

### Services

Services own everything that matters:

- business rules and state transitions;
- transactions (`prisma.$transaction`) where multiple rows must move together;
- **tenant-scoped** queries (see below);
- audit writes via `recordAuditEvent`;
- notifications via `notificationService`;
- enqueueing background work.

They signal failures with `createError(message, statusCode, code)` and are
exported as singletons (`export const investorService = new InvestorService()`).

### Validators

One Zod module per resource, exporting schemas and their inferred types.

## Tenant scoping

Every startup-scoped read, update, and delete goes through a composite selector
so the tenant boundary lives in the query itself:

```ts
// Correct the row cannot belong to another startup
await prisma.startupInvestor.findUnique({
  where: { startupId_id: { startupId, id: investorId } },
});

// Wrong middleware is the only thing standing between this and a leak
await prisma.startupInvestor.findUnique({ where: { id: investorId } });
```

Rules:

- Never infer a startup from an untrusted resource ID and then mutate
  unscoped.
- A cross-tenant miss should be indistinguishable from a missing resource.
- `requireMember` is defense in depth, not a substitute for scoping.

## Validation conventions

`validate(schema, target)` parses `body`, `params`, or `query`, replaces the
value on `req` with the parsed and coerced result, and returns a `400` with
`code: "VALIDATION_ERROR"` and a `[{ field, message }]` array on failure.

For `query`, the parsed value is installed with `Object.defineProperty`. Express
5 turned `req.query` into a getter that re-parses the URL on every access, so a
plain assignment is silently lost on the next read.

### URLs

`z.string().url()` alone accepts `javascript:` and other non-web schemes. For
anything user-controlled, refine it:

```ts
linkedinUrl: z.string().url().refine((v) => /^https?:\/\//i.test(v)).optional()
```

See `investor.schemas.ts` (`linkedinUrl`) and `startup.schemas.ts` (`website`).

### Shared vocabulary

Pipeline stages, investor types, round statuses, commitment statuses, task
statuses, and priorities live in `src/config/crm.ts`. Reuse them in both create
and update validators; never hardcode the string literals elsewhere. Values are
listed in the [glossary](glossary.md).

### Pagination

List endpoints take `page` (min 1, default 1) and `limit` (1–100, default
typically 20) as coerced query values, and return a paginated envelope with the
data array plus total/page metadata. Keep the envelope shape consistent the
frontend's `query-keys.ts` documents cases where a drifting shape broke
optimistic updates.

## Error model

```ts
throw createError("Investor not found", 404, "NOT_FOUND");
```

`errorHandler` is the only place that writes an error response:

```jsonc
{
  "code": "NOT_FOUND",        // present when the error carried one
  "error": "Investor not found",
  "stack": "…"                // development only
}
```

Errors created by `createError` are `isOperational` and their message is shown
to the caller. Anything else becomes a generic `500 Internal server error` with
the real error logged never leak internals into a response.

| Status | Typical `code` | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 400 | `VALIDATION_ERROR` | Zod rejected the payload |
| 401 | `UNAUTHORIZED`, `SESSION_EXPIRED` | No session, expired token, revoked family |
| 403 | `FORBIDDEN`, `INVITATION_INACTIVE` | Not a member, missing permission, invalid reviewer link |
| 404 | `NOT_FOUND` | Missing, or belongs to another tenant |
| 409 | resource-specific | Idempotency or state conflict |
| 429 | | Rate limited |
| 503 | | Readiness failure |

## Auditing and notifications

- `recordAuditEvent({ startupId, userId, action, entityType, entityId, changes, ipAddress })`
  is **best effort**: it never throws into the request path, because a failed
  audit insert must not roll back the business mutation it describes.
- Actions are `AUDIT_ACTIONS` (`create`, `update`, `delete`, `revoke`,
  `archive`, `login`, `logout`, `accept`, `decline`, `share`, `view`,
  `download`), extensible with a string.
- Account-level events (login, logout, password change) are not startup-scoped,
  but `audit_logs.startup_id` is required so they are written once per startup
  the user is currently an active member of.
- Notifications are created through `notificationService`, which persists the
  row and publishes on the realtime bus. Types are in `NOTIFICATION_TYPES`.

## Realtime from the backend

`src/events/realtime-bus.ts` is one per-user channel carrying both notification
and chat events, so the app holds one live connection per user rather than two.
`notification-bus.ts` re-exports it under the older name.

- Transport to the browser: SSE, via `notificationController.stream` and
  `utils/sse-writer.ts`.
- Transport between processes: Redis pub/sub, so the worker and every API
  replica reach whichever process holds the user's open stream.
- `REALTIME_BUS=memory` and `NODE_ENV=test` select the in-process
  implementation so unit tests need no Redis.

## Adding a resource checklist

1. **Schema** add the Prisma model with `startupId`, a `@@unique([startupId, id])`
   composite where it will be selected by, and appropriate indexes. Create the
   migration with `db:migrate:dev`.
2. **Validators** `src/validators/<resource>.schemas.ts`: params, body, and
   query schemas plus inferred types. Reuse `config/crm.ts` vocabularies.
3. **Service** `src/services/<resource>.service.ts`: tenant-scoped queries,
   business rules, audit writes, notifications, enqueues.
4. **Controller** `src/controllers/<resource>.controller.ts`: thin, wrapped in
   `asyncHandler`.
5. **Route** `src/routes/<resource>.routes.ts` with `mergeParams: true`, then
   mount it in `startup.routes.ts`. Compose
   `authenticate → validate(params) → requireMember → requirePermission → validate(body)`.
6. **Permissions** if a new resource/action pair is needed, add it to
   `config/permissions.ts` **and** the role templates, and migrate existing
   roles.
7. **Contract** update `openapi.yaml`, then
   `npm run gen:api-types --workspace=@raise/web`.
8. **Tests** `tests/unit/<resource>.*.test.ts` covering the happy path,
   validation failures, missing permission (403), and cross-tenant access
   (404/403). See [testing.md](testing.md).
9. **Docs** update [api-reference.md](api-reference.md), and
   [data-model.md](data-model.md) if the schema changed.

## Things to avoid

- Business logic in a controller or route.
- Prisma calls outside a service.
- An unscoped `findUnique({ where: { id } })` on a startup-owned model.
- Trusting `req.body` before `validate()` has run.
- Treating any `StartupMember.status` other than `"active"` as authorized.
- Bare `z.string().url()` on user-controlled input.
- Logging secrets, tokens, document contents, or raw user identifiers.
- Letting `openapi.yaml` drift from the implemented routes.
